# Big Backlink Project

## Project Overview
Big Backlink is a tool designed to track and analyze the performance of syndicated content across partner networks. When content is syndicated to partner sites, tracking these republications through traditional backlink analysis becomes challenging due to the volume of data and complexity of matching URLs. This tool automates the identification of partner-sourced backlinks from Ahrefs data, providing clear metrics and visualizations to measure syndication success.

### Business Context
- Content syndication is a key distribution strategy
- Need to track which content performs well on partner sites
- Measure the SEO value (Domain Rating) of partner republications
- Identify patterns in successful content distribution
- Track syndication growth and partner network health over time

### Technical Approach
- Uses domain matching with path validation for accuracy
- Processes Ahrefs backlink data against known partner URLs
- Calculates weighted metrics based on Domain Rating
- Generates visualizations for distribution analysis
- Stores timestamped reports for historical comparison

## Project Goals
- Identify Stacker content backlinks from Ahrefs data using partner domain matching
- Replace previous fuzzy-matching approach with more reliable domain-based identification
- Generate accurate metrics about backlink quality and distribution
- Provide easy-to-use GUI tool for analyzing and visualizing client data
- Support time series analysis of backlink performance

## Implementation Flow
1. Load partner domain list and client Ahrefs data
2. Clean and normalize URLs (remove www, standardize protocols)
3. Match using truncated path comparison (N=10 characters)
4. Generate metrics, visualizations, and reports in timestamped folders
5. Store analysis results for time series comparison

## Key Design Decisions
- Domain matching with partial path (N=10) provides optimal balance
- Domain-only matches filtered out for accuracy
- Client-specific output folders with standardized reporting
- Interactive GUI for client selection and analysis
- Time series support via timestamped reports
- Batch processing for large datasets
